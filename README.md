# AGILE Configurator

## Resource Optimizer
This configurator is a agile service that runs on the Gateway.
It opens an API for other AGILE services to be able to get optimum settings for the gateway.

## CSHL
Cluster-Specific Heuristic Learning algorithm is implemented to increase the performance of the CSP Solver.
It will be modified for AGILE specific domains to be able to integrate with Resource Optimizer.
